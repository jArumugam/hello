# hello
I am interested in Data Science. 

I am learning git so that I could share code with others. 

1. There are repos 
2. There is a master branch
3. To make changes, you create another branch (_working version_)
4. Change and make a commit (_saved changes_)
5. Open pull request (_propose changes_ from a branch)
6. Merge pull request (_add changes_ in master branch)
7. Delete version branch
